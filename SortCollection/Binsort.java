/*Key values are assigned to 'BINS'
 *Restriction: Only good for records between 0 and MaxKeyVal-1
 *Step 1 place into (MaxKeyVal) number of bins B, for O(n) time
 *Step 2 sort bins O(n)
 *The more bins, the less efficient O(n^2) worst case
 *Assigning to bins:  O(n)
 *Use linked lists to allow for key duplicates
 *BUCKET SORT does the same thing but with a range of values instead
